Using a Neural Network to Classify Notes
=====

Next I wrote a script, [mwav2fft](https://github.com/shri-k/music-analysis/blob/master/src/mwav2fft.py) (multiple wav files to fft), to process a set of wav files corresponding to a note and output a collection of vectors containing their fft magnitude and the class label. Before using this script, the wav files needed to be converted to 16 bit format using [sox](http://sox.sourceforge.net/)
